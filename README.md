✨Fun fact: Yomottoe is a misspell of "tomorrow"

Anyways, I am currently a college student majoring in Computer Science. I've done coding in high school, but nothing too much.
I've never used GitHub before, but I'll try to use it now because why not? I want to get more involved with coding.

I also do art. @yomottoe on instagram (most active), twitter, & other platforms. 

See you around! ✌
